# What is Gondolier?

Gondolier is an alternative to Docker desktop. It is a simple tool that allows you to manage your Docker images and containers. It is not a replacement for Docker's CLI.

# Why Gondolier + my experience with Docker desktop?

Docker desktop is a great tool, but it has some limitations as well as some bugs. Also it is not open source. Gondolier is a simple alternative that works on Linux and Mac.

Also, here is **my experience** with Docker desktop:\
When I installed Docker desktop on my Linux machine, I was not able to see or use all the images and containers that I "previously" created using Docker's CLI. While using Docker desktop, I could only create and see the images and containers that I created using Docker desktop.
After I uninstalled the Docker desktop, all was fine again. I am not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but it is not acceptable for me. I need to see and use all my images and containers, no matter how I created them.

# Supported platforms

- Linux
- Mac (not tested yet, but it should work)
- Windows WSL (not tested yet)

# How to use Gondolier?

Just download the Gondolier repo and run the following command:

```python
python3 gondolier.py
```

# Requirements
